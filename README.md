# Bootstrap 101 Project
##### A responsive website design using Bootstrap 5.1.3

This site's design is based on [an existing website](https://codescandy.com/geeks-bootstrap-5/) as a way of practicing the use of Bootstrap to create a responsive page.

It features a:
- navbar with dropdown menus, 
- hero image section, 
- scrolling carousel of featured cards
- small amount of jQuery and internal CSS

*Note that the homepage does not link elsewhere, as the purpose of this project was to practice Bootstrap design rather than creating a fully functional website.*
